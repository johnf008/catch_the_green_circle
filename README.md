## About the Project
This mini HTML game was made for the SayChees YSWS event for Hack Club. I was originally going to ship a game made with p5.js, but after realizing that the file size was too long,

## How to Play
To play this game, you will need to catch the green circles by moving left and right using the buttons on the screen. For every circle you catch, you get one point. However, if you miss
a circle, you loose a point. 

## Where can I play it?

You can play it by scanning the QR code, or by clicking:
